                Lord Neil B. Gibson&apos;s journey started at his birth in Walton
                Hall. He was born on September 10th, 1963. Later in life, through
                accession of lands, Lord Neil B. Gibson retained his title as seen
                today — Lord of Wheldrake and Warter Priory, pursuant to the Law
                of Property Act 1925.

                Wheldrake and Warter Priory are within a 25-mile radius as the
                crow flies of each other. Walton Hall is a stately home in the
                county of West Yorkshire, England, near Wakefield. It was built in
                the Palladian style in 1767 on an island within a 26-acre lake, on
                the site of a former moated medieval hall.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was the ancestral home of the naturalist and traveller Charles
                Waterton, who made Walton Hall into the world&apos;s first
                wildfowl and nature reserve. The Waterton Collection is now in
                Wakefield Museum, and Walton Hall is today part of the Waterton
                Park Hotel.
